## What are Candle Shadows?

Candle shadows are the thin lines that extend above and below the body
of a candlestick. They represent the highest and lowest prices that the
asset traded at during the period represented by the candlestick.

## Types of Candle Shadows

There are four main types of candle shadows:

1.  **Upper shadows:** Upper shadows indicate that the asset traded at a
    higher price during the period represented by the candlestick, but
    that price was not sustained.
2.  **Lower shadows:** Lower shadows indicate that the asset traded at a
    lower price during the period represented by the candlestick, but
    that price was not sustained.
3.  **Long upper and lower shadows:** Long upper and lower shadows
    indicate that the asset traded at a much higher or lower price
    during the period represented by the candlestick, but that price was
    not sustained.
4.  **Wide range candles:** Wide range candles have long upper and lower
    shadows, which indicate that the asset traded at a much higher and
    lower price during the period represented by the candlestick.

## How to Trade Candle Shadows

There are a few different ways to trade candle shadows. One common
strategy is to trade the breakout of a candle shadow. For example, if a
candlestick has a long upper shadow, you could trade a buy order with a
stop loss below the low of the candlestick and a take profit target at
the high of the candlestick.

Another strategy is to trade the retracement of a candle shadow. For
example, if a candlestick has a long lower shadow, you could trade a
sell order with a stop loss above the high of the candlestick and a take
profit target at the low of the candlestick.

shadow trading strategies. Some of the most popular technical indicators
